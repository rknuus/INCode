= INCode Design

== About
The design of INCode is based on the book <<RightingSoftwareBook,Righting Software>> by Juval Löwy (check out the Software Engineering Radio <<RightingSoftwarePodcast,podcast episode>>), mainly to apply the ideas onto a practical example.

INCode is a... %%TODO(KNR)%%

== Initial analyses
=== Essential use case analysis
%%TODO(KNR)%%

=== Volatility Analysis
The initial volatility analysis identifies:

- volatility on the axis of the same customer at different times: C++ versions, clang versions, GUI technologies, diagram languages
- volatility on the axis of multiple customers at the same time: ways to interact?!

=== Quality Attributes
Relevant quality attributes based on Part I, chapter 3, sub chapters Layered Approach/Using Services are:

- throughput (e.g. when applying INCode on large projects like LLVM)
- responsiveness (tool must respond in reasonable time while interacting)

All other quality attributes are currently not considered to be relevant:

- scalability
- security
- availability
- reliability
- consistency
- synchronization
